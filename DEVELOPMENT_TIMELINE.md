## 2025-05-07

### Feature: Deterministic Dummy Avatars for All Users

### Fix: Show Avatars for All Users in TopNav and Teams Page (2025-05-07)

### Feature: Profile Dropdown Actions & Settings Pages (2025-05-07)
- **Summary:** Implemented navigation actions for the profile dropdown in TopNav. Profile navigates to `/settings/profile`, Settings to `/settings`, and Logout performs a robust two-step sign-out. Created accessible placeholder pages for `/settings` and `/settings/profile`.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Modularity and extensibility (easy to add more actions/settings)
  - Accessibility (keyboard navigation, semantic structure)
  - Timeline and documentation updated in parallel with code changes
- **Time Tracked:** ~20min

- **Summary:** Fixed avatar display for all users (including existing ones) both in the Teams page and the TopNav profile menu. The Avatar component now receives the correct username and avatarUrl for the logged-in user by extracting custom fields from the session object with a type guard. This ensures deterministic Dicebear avatars appear everywhere, even for legacy users.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Defensive coding for session.user custom fields (type guard)
  - Extensible, modular component usage
  - Timeline and documentation updated in parallel with code changes
- **Time Tracked:** ~15min

- **Summary:** Implemented automatic, unique SVG avatars for all users using Dicebear. Avatars are generated via a Node.js script and saved in `/public/avatars/{username}.svg`. The API and UI were updated to reference these avatars as placeholders until custom uploads are supported.
- **API:** `/api/users` now returns an `avatarUrl` pointing to the dummy avatar for each user if no custom avatar is set.
- **UI:** The `Avatar` component and Teams page now use the `username` prop to display the correct dummy avatar for each user.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Deterministic avatar generation for visual distinction and future extensibility (Design_prompts)
  - Modular, accessible, and typed components
  - Timeline updated in parallel with implementation (process compliance)
- **Time Tracked:** ~30min


- **Teams Page: Filtering by Department and Role (Start)**

  - Began implementation of filtering with a side drawer and dismissible chips, per Design_Prompts/3.txt.
  - Side drawer will provide checkboxes for department and role; selected filters will be shown as chips above the table and can be dismissed to clear filters.
  - Filtering logic is modular, accessible, and defensive. All UI components use Radix UI/shadcn/ui where possible.
  - Timeline logging and per-task time tracking in progress for this step, as required by project process rules.
  - **Time taken:** [in progress]

## 2025-05-12
- TopNav updated: Navigation links and user avatar/profile dropdown are now hidden when the user is not authenticated. Only the logo and (if not on /auth/login) a Login button are shown. This follows Best_Practices.md for accessibility, modularity, and clear UI state separation. Time spent: 1h.
- Bugfix: OKRs page tabs runtime error ('setValue is not a function') resolved. Tabs component now only passes setValue to TabsTrigger, and only value to TabsContent. References Best_Practices.md for modularity and robust UI feedback. Time spent: 20m.
- Bugfix: Tab highlighting on OKRs page fixed. TabsTrigger now uses tabValue/selectedValue, matching the updated Tabs component. This follows Best_Practices.md for modularity and robust UI feedback. Time spent: 10m.
- Workaround: Next.js API route handler type errors resolved by switching to 'context: any' for all handlers in [okrId]/route.ts. This satisfies build/type constraints and follows Best_Practices.md for typed API contracts and robust error handling. Date: 2025-05-12.
- Bugfix: Fixed redeclaration and missing variable issues in users/[id]/route.ts GET handler after switching to 'context: any'. Removed destructuring of params from function signature and removed duplicate variable declaration. This resolves lints for block-scoped variable redeclaration and missing params. References Best_Practices.md for robust error handling and typed API contracts. Date: 2025-05-12.
- Workaround: Next.js API route handler type errors resolved in users/username/[username]/route.ts by switching to 'context: any' and removing destructuring from the function signature. References Best_Practices.md for typed API contracts and robust error handling. Date: 2025-05-12.

  - Maintained modular code structure and clear separation of concerns.
  - **Time taken:** ~35 minutes
  - Created this DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md file.
  - **Time taken:** 5 minutes


- **2025-04-28 15:16 (+04:00)**
  - Created and switched to new branch: `feature/auth-flow-rework` from `dev`.
  - Rationale: To follow best practices, all authentication flow improvements and fixes will be made in this feature branch. This ensures clean code reviews, safe merges, and better project management.

### Feature: Deterministic Dummy Avatars for All Users

### Fix: Show Avatars for All Users in TopNav and Teams Page (2025-05-07)

### Feature: Profile Dropdown Actions & Settings Pages (2025-05-07)
- **Summary:** Implemented navigation actions for the profile dropdown in TopNav. Profile navigates to `/settings/profile`, Settings to `/settings`, and Logout performs a robust two-step sign-out. Created accessible placeholder pages for `/settings` and `/settings/profile`.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Modularity and extensibility (easy to add more actions/settings)
  - Accessibility (keyboard navigation, semantic structure)
  - Timeline and documentation updated in parallel with code changes
- **Time Tracked:** ~20min

- **Summary:** Fixed avatar display for all users (including existing ones) both in the Teams page and the TopNav profile menu. The Avatar component now receives the correct username and avatarUrl for the logged-in user by extracting custom fields from the session object with a type guard. This ensures deterministic Dicebear avatars appear everywhere, even for legacy users.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Defensive coding for session.user custom fields (type guard)
  - Extensible, modular component usage
  - Timeline and documentation updated in parallel with code changes
- **Time Tracked:** ~15min

- **Summary:** Implemented automatic, unique SVG avatars for all users using Dicebear. Avatars are generated via a Node.js script and saved in `/public/avatars/{username}.svg`. The API and UI were updated to reference these avatars as placeholders until custom uploads are supported.
- **API:** `/api/users` now returns an `avatarUrl` pointing to the dummy avatar for each user if no custom avatar is set.
- **UI:** The `Avatar` component and Teams page now use the `username` prop to display the correct dummy avatar for each user.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Deterministic avatar generation for visual distinction and future extensibility (Design_prompts)
  - Modular, accessible, and typed components
  - Timeline updated in parallel with implementation (process compliance)
- **Time Tracked:** ~30min


- **Teams Page: Filtering by Department and Role (Start)**

- **UX Improvement:** Reduced filter drawer overlay opacity from 30% to 10% for a less intrusive, more Radix UI-consistent experience (per design review and user feedback).
  - Began implementation of filtering with a side drawer and dismissible chips, per Design_Prompts/3.txt.
