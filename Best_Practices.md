# Best Practices for OKR App Development

## 1. Accessibility & Modularity
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible and have proper ARIA labels
- Use semantic HTML elements and proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Create reusable, modular components with clear interfaces
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

## 2. Authentication & Security
- Use NextAuth.js for authentication with JWT strategy
- Implement proper session management with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Protect sensitive routes with middleware
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookie attributes

## 3. API Design
- Use RESTful conventions for API endpoints
- Version your API (e.g., `/api/v1/...`)
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Use consistent response formats
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Document all API endpoints with examples

## 4. State Management
- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Prefer local component state when possible
- Use SWR or React Query for server state
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Invalidate cache when data changes

## 5. Performance
- Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
- Optimize images and static assets
- Use next/image for image optimization
- Implement proper caching headers
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Use server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) when possible
- Implement proper error boundaries

## 6. Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and custom hooks
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock API calls in tests
- Test error states and edge cases
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Maintain good test coverage (aim for 80%+)

## 7. Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document environment variables
- Document API endpoints
- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
- Document component props and usage
- Keep changelog and development timeline updated
- Document deployment process

## 8. Development Workflow
- Use feature branches for new features
- Create pull requests for code review
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused
- Rebase before merging to main
- Use meaningful branch names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-form-validation`)
- Delete merged branches

## 9. Error Handling & Logging
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors to a monitoring service
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log API request/response for debugging
- Implement proper error recovery
- Monitor application errors in production

## 10. Code Style & Quality
- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deeply nested callbacks
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Handle promises properly
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Destructure objects and arrays when appropriate
- Use template literals for string interpolation

## Reference: Design Prompts Folder
- The term "Design Prompts" in code comments refers to the folder `okr_app_ws/okr-app/Design_Prompts/`.
- This folder contains prompt `.txt` files with UI/UX and architectural guidance for the OKR App.
- Contributors should refer to these prompts as needed for design, usability, and implementation decisions.

**Never create a new file unless necessary, and always prioritize code reuse wherever applicable.**

_This document is updated as new best practices are established. All contributors must review and follow these guidelines._
