Key confirmed requirements:

Bulk invite: Modal supports multiple emails at once (comma, semicolon, newline, or space separated).
Required field: Emails only.
On invite: Send an email with a link to /register?email=... (email prefilled).
Button placement:
Bottom-left of table when Manage Users is enabled (Admin only).
In empty state if filters return no results (Admin only).
Never for non-admins; show friendly empty state for non-admins.
Text for empty state will be tailored for Admins (prompt to invite) and non-admins (informational, no invite option).
Reuse existing Button, Modal, and EmptyState components per Best_Practices.md.
Next actions:

Audit and reuse existing modal/button/empty state components.
Implement Invite New User button logic and placement (bottom-left, empty state).
Build the bulk invite modal (multi-email, validation, accessible).
Wire up backend/API call to send invite emails with /register link.
Add/adjust empty state text for both Admins and non-admins.
Test all flows for both Admin and non-admin roles.

Implementation Steps
Button Placement & Visibility
Render the “Invite New User” button at the bottom-left of the table (absolute/fixed, responsive) when Manage Users is enabled and user is Admin.
Render the button in the empty state if filters return no results and user is Admin.
For non-admins, show only a role-appropriate empty state (no invite button).
Bulk Invite Modal
Reuse the shared Modal component (src/components/ui/Modal.tsx) for consistent UI/UX.
Modal will have:
Title: “Invite New Users”
Multi-line email input (accepts comma, semicolon, space, or newline separated emails)
Validation for email format and duplicates
Accessible labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation
Actions: Cancel, Send Invites (uses shared Button component)
On submit, call the backend to send invites with /register?email=... links.
Empty State
Reuse the EmptyState component (src/components/okr/EmptyState.tsx).
Admins: Show message like “No team members yet. Invite your first user!” with invite button.
Non-admins: Show message like “No team members yet. Please contact your administrator to be invited.” (no button).
Component Reuse & Best Practices
Use shared Button and Modal components.
Ensure all interactive elements have proper cursor, focus, and hover states.
Fully responsive and accessible.
