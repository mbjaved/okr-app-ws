# Reports Page Requirements Document

## Overview
The Reports page will provide users with actionable insights and summaries about OKRs, teams, and individual progress. This document outlines the requirements, constraints, and best practices for implementing the Reports page in the OKR application.

---

## 1. General Guidelines
- **Strictly follow `Best_Practices.md` and `PROJECT_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.**
- **Reuse existing components** wherever possible (tables, cards, filters, avatars, modals, etc.).
- **Do not create new files/components unless absolutely necessary.**
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality must remain unaffected.
- **Maintain accessibility, responsiveness, and consistent theming** across the app.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Reports Dashboard**: Display summary cards and charts for key OKR metrics (progress, status breakdown, team/individual performance).
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Allow users to filter and sort reports by time period, team, individual, OKR status, etc.
- **Drill-down**: Enable users to click on summary elements to view detailed lists or breakdowns.
- **Export**: Provide export options (CSV, PDF) if feasible using existing or minimal new logic.
- **Navigation**: Integrate with existing navigation and breadcrumbs; follow app layout conventions.
- **Data Fetching**: Use established hooks/APIs; do not create new endpoints unless strictly required.

---

## 3. Technical Constraints
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage OKRs page, Dashboard, and Team page components for UI and logic.
- **Minimal New Code**: Only introduce new files/components if no suitable alternative exists.
- **Incremental, Non-Destructive Changes**: All updates must be backward-compatible.
- **Testing**: Adjust or add tests for new logic/UI as needed.

---

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. **Audit existing components** for reuse.
2. **Scaffold Reports page** with existing layout/navigation patterns.
3. **Integrate reusable UI components** for cards, tables, filters, etc.
4. **Implement data fetching** using established hooks/APIs.
5. **Add filtering, sorting, and export features** (reuse logic from OKRs page).
6. **Ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and theming.**
7. **Write/adjust tests** as needed.
8. **Document structure and deviations from best practices (with justification).**

---

## 5. Review & QA
- **Manual QA**: Verify all new functionality and ensure no regressions.
- **Peer Review**: All code to be reviewed before merging.
- **Documentation**: Update README and internal docs as needed.

---

## 6. Approval
- All requirements and constraints in this document must be met before merging the Reports page to main/dev.

*This document is to be updated as requirements evolve or upon user feedback.*
